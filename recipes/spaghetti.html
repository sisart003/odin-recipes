    <h2>Spaghetti Recipe (yum!)</h2>
    <p>This recipe is every kid’s favorite – Filipino Spaghetti – and comes from the orphanage that I worked at for a year in Cebu. Spaghetti, hot dogs, tomato sauce, and seasonings. So simple, so good.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>For the meat sauce:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. spaghetti noodles</li>
        <li>1 lb. Italian tomato sauce (the kind they used was called “Italian” but tasted sweet and was very smooth in texture)/li>
        <li>8 ounces tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>1 lb. ground pork</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced carrots and red peppers</li>
        <li>2 cups diced or thinly sliced hot dogs</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon seasoning mix</li>
        <li>7 ounces evaporated milk</li>
        <li>grated cheese for topping (they use a processed cheese similar to Velveeta)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the noodles according to package directions. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place the garlic, onion, and oil in a large saucepan or skillet. Saute for 3-4 minutes or until soft and fragrant. Add the ground pork and brown the meat until it’s completely cooked.</li>
        <li>Add the minced vegetables and hot dog pieces and stir to combine. Add the water and allow the mixture to simmer for 10-15 minutes. Add the tomato sauce and tomato paste to the meat and continue to simmer the mixture for another 10-15 minutes. Add the evaporated milk and salt and stir until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Combine the noodles and the sauce in a large pot or mixing bowl. Top with grated cheese. At Cherne they grate a processed cheese similar to Velveeta and let it melt into the top layer of the spaghetti.</li>
    </ol>
